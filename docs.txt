To “cancel” a task, you can write {0} or {}; if the weights are not indicated by curly braces at all, then the weight of the task
will be taken as one (1);

You can make {0}/{} the main task and make each weight for the subtasks, so you get the main sum for the main one
tasks through subtasks automatically;

You can enter in curly brackets (weight indicators):
     - integer (for example, {1})
     - real number (for example, {1.25})
     - Nothing ({})
     - additional signs from the list, namely: *+ (for example, {*} or {+}) - such tasks are not taken into account in calculating bar progress;
     - combinations of additional characters and numbers (for example, {1.33+} or {1*})

You can also enable “hierarchical mode”, in which each subtask, depending on the “depth level” in the list, will
have less and less weight (depth level - an indicator of how many steps a list element represents);

Subtask weight formula in hierarchical mode:

K = W/(1+X), W - initial task weight, X - depth level, K - final task weight;

When the task is on its own, that is, at zero level, the weight remains the same, otherwise it decreases according to a hyperbolic function.
